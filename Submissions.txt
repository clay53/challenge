3. Describe the difficulties you faced (if any) while working on the challenge and how you tackled them.
 * I Started at ~midnight. I tackled this problem by checking my solution repeatedly to ensure I'm not halucinating.
 * I got hung up on the partial rehydration part a bit. I tackled it by putting all the rehydration into the tryCalculateResult function and then tackling the results showing on click part.
 * I also haven't used JSDoc in a bit, so I had to look up some syntax and mess with it for longer than I probably should have.
 * I just installed a new OS on this computer, so I had to install and setup some LSPs and change some environment settings along the way.
